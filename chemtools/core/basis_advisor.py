"""Program-agnostic basis-set advisor.

The ``suggest_basis_set`` heuristic recommends a basis set + ECP given a
molecule's element list and a purpose tag (geometry / single-point /
correlated / heavy). The same recommendation is appropriate for any
quantum-chemistry program — NWChem, Molcas, ORCA, Molpro — since the
underlying basis sets (def2-SVP, cc-pVTZ, ...) are universal.

Originally lived in ``programs/nwchem/strategy/input_advisors.py``; moved
here so future program plugins can use it without depending on the
NWChem package.

    Parameters
    ----------
    elements
        Element symbols present in the molecule. Case-insensitive; the
        result echoes the normalized (title-case) symbols.
    purpose
        One of ``"geometry"`` (fast opt), ``"single_point"`` (DFT energy),
        ``"correlated"`` (MP2/CCSD), or ``"heavy_elements"`` (post-Kr).
    library_path
        Accepted for backward compatibility; the recommendation logic is
        library-agnostic, so the value is ignored.
